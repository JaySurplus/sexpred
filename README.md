##Sexual Predator Identification

####Overview
This task belongs to [PAN2012](http://www.uni-weimar.de/medien/webis/events/pan-12/pan12-web/author-identification.html) author identification part.


####Task
The goal of this sub-task is to identify classes of authors, namely online predators. You will be given chat logs involving two (or more) people and have to determine who is the one trying to convince the other(s) to provide some sexual favour. You will also need to identify the particular conversation where the person exploits his bad behavior.

The task can therefore be divided into two parts:

1. Identify the predators (within all the users)
2. Identify the part (the lines) of the predator conversations which are the most distinctive of the predator bad behavior


Given the public nature of the dataset, we ask the participants not to use external or online resources for resolving this task (e.g. search engines) but to extract evidence from the provided datasets only.
